# TPC-Compiler


## Guideline

To generate the compiler, execute the command-line :
```shell
make
```

The tpcc file will be generated in the bin folder. 
To compile a tpc project, use the following command : 
```shell
./bin/tpcc <your_source.tpc> [OPTIONS] [--]
```
or 
```shell
./bin/tpcc < your_source.tpc [OPTIONS] [--]
```
